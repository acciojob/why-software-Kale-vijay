	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>There are many career options available to you. For instance, you can decide to work either as an independent contractor or within a larger company. Having this option allows you to choose a work environmentand lifestyle that fits your requirements.
	You also have the ability to work in a wide range of industries, and there's typically room for advancement within software development. After starting as an entry-level programmer, software developers can advance into senior programming positions. Programmers can often then move into management positions where they oversee the development process rather than spending their time coding.</p>
